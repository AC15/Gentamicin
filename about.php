        <h1>About Gentamicin</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For serious infections, Gentamicin is given intravenously. The first dose of Gentamicin is calculated using a creatinine clearance test (blood test) and the weight of the patient along with other parameters. The timing of the given first dose is recorded. 6-14 hours after the first dose, the serum levels of the Gentamicin are measured. Depending upon the results of the blood levels and using a Nomogram the subsequent doses are calculated. The aim of this research is to explain the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin, in relation to the timing of the subsequent dosage.</p>

        <h2>What is Pharmacokinetics (PK)</h2>
        <p>PK is the study of time course of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a drug, compound, or new chemical activity after it’s administration to the body. [Fan J.2014] In non-medical terms, it is what the body does to the drug.</p>
        <p>As we will be giving the drug intravenously i.e. through the vein, absorption of the drug is not relevant. Through veins Gentamicin reaches lungs. It is neither metabolised nor excreted through lungs and passes through lungs to arterial side. Gentamicin reaches most of the organs through arterial supply. The drug seeps through the arteries in the extracellular space to reach the organs.</p>
        <p>The actual availability of the drug is affected by the amount passed to the extracellular space. There are conditions like Burns, Ascites, cystic fibrosis, and pregnancy where extracellular fluid volume is not within normal range, hence concentration results are not useful in calculating the dose- this also applies to elderly people. For targets within a cell or in the brain, the drug must cross the cell membrane or blood brain barrier and hence serum concentration is not always reflecting the toxic or therapeutic levels.</p>
        <p>Excretion of Gentamicin occurs mainly through the Kidneys and depends upon the glomerular filtration rate. As the drug concentration falls, the amount of drug filtered per unit of time diminishes. The plasma volume freed of drug per unit time is termed clearance; the concentration of the drug in the blood is dependent on the clearance. The dose is important in predicting the drug concentration but pharmacokinetic parameters like Maximum clearance(Cmax), area-under-the concentration-time-curve(AUC) and Minimum clearance (Cmin) are better predictors of the outcome. [MacGowan,2001] The AUC is a good index of antibiotic exposure and it depends directly on dosage, modified by absorption and plasma clearance.</p>

        <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
        <p>Pharmacokinetics is time dependant, hence recording the exact time of administration and time of taking blood needs to be recorded accurately.</p>
        <p>The drug is excreted through the kidneys hence Renal function plays an important part in deciding the dose. The renal function needs to be monitored daily for the early diagnosis of nephrotoxicity. The weight is important as it is a major factor in available extracellular space and distribution of the drug.</p>
        <p>In obese patient ideal weight is used rather than actual weight to avoid overdosing. Doses are capped at the maximum dose. (NHS Lothian,2017) Weight and renal function are used in calculating the first dose.</p>
        <p>The drug concentration depends upon the quantity of dose and pharmacokinetics of Gentamicin. Cure is associated with peaks 4-5mg/L in some illnesses but mortality from gram negative septicaemia is reduced if concentration above 5mg/l are reached. BNF recommends dose of Gentamicin 5-7mg/kg/day. [Thomson A, 2004]</p>
        <p>When we study Pharmacodynamics, we study the effect of drug concentration on the body. Drug concentration is dependent on Pharmacokinetics, thus Pharmacokinetic is related to the pharmacodynamics through drug concentration.</p>
        <p>The MIC, mean inhibitory concentration is the minimal concentration required to kill bacteria. Lower MIC value indicate that less drug is required. We need to achieve optimum MIC to achieve a good response. If we get concentrations higher than MIC, chances of drug side effects and toxicity increase. Keeping the dosage to the minimum required, using MIC score, drug resistance can be prevented.</p>

        <h2>Hartford Nomogram</h2>
        <p>Traditionally Gentamicin was administered as a multiple daily dose regime. The blood samples were taken 1 hour after the dose and then just before giving the subsequent dose. Gentamicin peaks shortly after IV administration and 4 hours after that the level falls i.e. trough. The target range to provide desired therapeutic effect was achieved at the peak level of Gentamicin which is 5-10mg/L and the trough level is <2 mg/L.  This method was not convenient because taking frequent blood samples increased the workload of doctors and Laboratory staff. There were forgotten samples, lost samples, or unreported samples. Therapeutic drug monitoring showed that adequate peak levels were not achieved, and troughs were too low.</p>

        <p>The once daily high dose regime is used by Highland hospitals and is based on Greater Glasgow & Clyde (GGC) Protocol [2017], it is designed to overcome the problems encountered with the multiple dose regime. It is convenient and there is no need to measure peak levels because the high dose is always going to give results above 10mg/L. There is no need to check bloods frequently, only one sample test is enough. The sample time has a wide range of 6 – 14 hours after the start of the first infusion. This can be fitted around the busy schedule of the duty doctors, avoiding problems of wrong time and double dose.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Serum concentration cannot predict Bacterial susceptibility which plays an important role in response determination. The volume of extravascular concentration cannot be derived from Serum Concentration either.</p>
        <p>Ototoxicity is duration dependant and has no correlation with the serum level. That is why it is important not to exceed the therapeutic number of doses.</p>
